Azure:
There's a calculator: http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/calculator/?scenario=full
XS is best processor + RAM / dollar, easy
XS is limited to 5 Mbs total in/out bandwidth and 20 GB storage
Small is 100 Mbs
Walkthrough on choosing types of storage: 
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh767287.aspx

Storage account:
There's a cool explorer: http://azurestorageexplorer.codeplex.com/
Storage accounts are Blobs, Azure Queues, and Table storage
A single storage account can be no larger that 100TB
Storage space is ALL stored data, including names / metadata (content of all blobs, queues, and tables)
There are lots of breaking changes between SDK versions. E.g. a 1.6 app can't run on a 2.2 emulator and vice-versa
A 1.7 app should run on 2.2 emulator, but does not in my experience.
The 2.3 and 2.2 SDK can run side by side on a machine, but 2.2 cannot be hosted in a 2.3 environment and vice-versa
Be sure to check "breaking changes" with each release - it has saved me several times

There are naming and string restrictions on things like blob names, queue names, table PK/RK, etc.

Table storage
A "no-sql" solution
No relationships
No joining
Max total "row" size: 1MB Including PartitionKey, RowKey, Timestamp.
Max single column size: 64K (max 252 columns per row)
Max number of rows returned in a single request: 1000
you will not get rows between partition keys
some transaction support (100 actions max)
Max table size: 100TB (per storage account)

Blob storage
Doesn't support direct client uploads (CORS)
A handy file storage mechanism 
Two major types
-Block blobs
Ordered writing / reading 
Uploads are done per block, 
4MB max per block
2GB max per blob (in emulator)
200GB max per blob (in production)
50,000 max blocks per blob
CORS support added in storage client 3.0 (2013-08-15 protocol)
CORS support in the emulator added 2.2 of emulator

-Page blobs
Random writing / reading
Think internet stream
512 byte segments as pages
up to 4MB written at once
max size of 1TB total
Size must be predefined (if you allocate 1TB then you're charged for that 1TB)

Azure queues
Queue message: 64K
if NOT xml-safe: 48K (because automatic base64)
At-Least-Once
NOT guaranteed ordering
Max message lifetime: 7 days
Max size of a queue: 100TB (as part of the storage account)
Get Length is approximate

Azure service bus
Queue message: 256k 
Max header: 64K again / 48K XML-safe thing
Exactly-once
ARE guaranteed ordering
Max message lifetime: forever
Max size of a bus: 5GB (configured @ creation)
Get length is exact

If you need at most once / guaranteed ordering use service bus queues (10x more expensive though)
P.S. 10x more expensive means that it is a whopping $1.00 / Million transactions, rather than $0.10 / 1 Million
